        <p><b>1. Research Summary (Key Information):</b></p>

        <p>
          The information in this section is intended to be an introduction to
          the study only. Details of the study are listed in the sections below.
          You can ask questions about the study now and at any time in the
          future, by contacting us at honeylabonline+experiments@gmail.com.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this study is to examine how memory and perceptual
          functions interact in the brain. We are interested how the brain
          enables us to perceive streams of information over time. Participation
          is this study will typically take 15-50 minutes. Participants are
          required to attend and respond to a variety of stimuli, including
          sequences of spoken language, voiced syllables, and visual cues. There
          are no known physical or psychological risks associated with your
          participation in this study, other than the possibility of fatigue,
          boredom, or slight discomfort. The only cost for participation is a
          participant’s time. The benefit of participating in this study is to
          be involved in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the human
          brain. Participants are compensated at a flat rate or via course
          credit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
        </p>

        <p><b>2. Why is this research being done?</b></p>

        <p>
          This research is being done to examine how memory and perceptual
          functions interact in the brain. In particular, we are interested how
          the brain enables us to perceive streams of information over time.
          People between the ages of 18-65 who speak English may join.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p><b>3. What will happen if you join this study?</b></p>

        <p>
          If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following
          things:
        </p>

        <p>
          You will participate in a computerized task. You will see a series of
          images or short movies on the screen or may hear a series of sounds or
          words. Your task is to carefully examine each image or movie, or to
          carefully listen to each sequence of sounds, so that you can report
          what you saw or heard. Your reading or listening may be interrupted by
          alternate tasks, such as having to wait for 15 seconds, simple
          counting of geometric shapes, or answering comprehension questions
          about a simple situation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes we will ask you to directly report what you saw or heard,
          for example by providing a yes/no response (e.g. "Was the image
          moving?" or "Did you hear the same sound twice in a row?"). In other
          cases, we may ask you to make a judgment about images (e.g. "Which
          images belong together?") or about other features of the stimuli (e.g.
          "Which sound was louder?"). In still other cases, we may ask you to
          make a prediction about the stimuli (e.g. “What would you expect to
          hear or see next?”).
        </p>

        <p>
          Alternatively, you may be tested on your memory of what you saw or
          heard or asked to provide short descriptions of life events. You may
          also be asked to answer questions about your ability to pay attention
          and focus. After completing the main experiment, we will ask you to
          fill out a brief questionnaire that asks about some optional personal
          information (e.g., your age-range) and gives you an opportunity to
          comment on your experience performing the task. The study will
          typically take 20-50 minutes to complete. The first phase of the
          experiment will typically take 10-30 minutes. The second and third
          phase of the experiment will each take 5-10 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
          All participants will be exposed to all phases of the experiment but
          the order in which participants see each phase may differ. The
          ordering of phases seen by each participant are chosen at random, like
          a coin flip. Additionally, participants may see different stimuli, and
          the order and selection of these stimuli is chosen at random, like
          drawing numbers from a hat. At the end of the experiment, you will be
          asked to complete some brief surveys about the study and your
          experience.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p><b>How long will you be in the study?</b></p>
        <p>You will be in this study for 30-50 minutes.</p>

        <br />
        <p><b>4. What are the risks or discomforts of the study?</b></p>

        <p>
          You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions, or when
          you are completing questionnaires. There is a risk when answering
          these questions that information about you may become known to people
          outside this study. While personally identifiable information is not
          collected in this study, we do collect demographics information
          including but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, handedness, and
          age of language acquisition. Please note that all demographic
          questions are optional and are not required to successfully
          participate in this study. We also collect information with an
          attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) questionnaire. It has
          not been administered for the purpose of diagnosis, but only to
          measure the variations in how people report their experience with
          sustained attention. If you feel that your survey responses are
          indicative of a problem with attention, and would like to explore this
          issue further, basic information about ADHD can be found at WebMD
          (https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-ways-to-tell) and via contacting
          your health professionals. Information from online studies will be de-
          coupled from online IDs to decrease the risk of linking this
          information with your person. This information will be shared with the
          NIH’s NDA and other databases, but only after de-identification.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aside from this, the risks associated with participation in this study
          are no greater than those encountered in daily life or during the
          performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or
          tests.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p><b>5. Are there benefits to being in the study?</b></p>

        <p>
          There is no direct benefit to you from being in this study. This study
          may benefit society if the results lead to a better understanding of
          how people process streams of information.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          <b>6. What are your options if you do not want to be in the study?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You choose
          whether to participate. If you decide not to participate, there are no
          penalties, and you will not lose any benefits to which you would
          otherwise be entitled. If you are employed by or are a student at
          Johns Hopkins University or Johns Hopkins Hospital, your employment or
          enrollment will not be affected.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p><b>7. Will it cost you anything to be in this study?</b></p>

        <p>The only costs to participants are their time and attention.</p>

        <br />
        <p><b>8. Will you be paid if you join this study?</b></p>

        <p>
          If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive monetary
          compensation ($8-$10 per hour) for your participation. If you end your
          participation before completing the study, you will be paid for your
          participation up to that time. Payments are made via Amazon’s mTurk
          platform. If experiments are performed via SONA, participants will
          receive course credit.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p><b>9. Can you leave the study early?</b></p>

        <p>
          You can agree to be in the study now and change your mind later,
          without any penalty or loss of benefits or decrease in payment for
          your time. If you wish to stop, please tell us right away. If you want
          to withdraw from the study, please convey this to the experimenter.
          Leaving this study early will not affect your employment/education.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p><b>10. Why might we take you out of the study early?</b></p>

        <p>You may be taken out of the study if:</p>
        <p>- Staying in the study would be harmful.</p>
        <p>- You fail to follow instructions.</p>
        <p>- The study is cancelled.</p>
        <p>
          - There may be other reasons to take you out of the study that we do
          not know at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are taken out of the study early, Johns Hopkins may use or give
          out your information that it has already collected if the information
          is needed for this study or any follow-up activities.

        </p>

        <p>
          TAny study records that identify you will be kept confidential to the
          extent possible by law. The records from your participation may be
          reviewed by people responsible for making sure that research is done
          properly, including members of the Johns Hopkins University Homewood
          Institutional Review Board and officials from government agencies such
          as the National Institutes of Health and the Office for Human Research
          Protections (all of these people are required to keep your identity
          confidential). Otherwise, records that identify you will be available
          only to people working on the study, unless you give permission for
          other people to see the records. The experimental data and
          questionnaire responses collected during your participation will be
          anonymized.
        </p>

        <p>
          De-identified and anonymized data (e.g. response times, key presses,
          and questionnaire responses) may be made freely available to the
          scientific community to encourage scientific openness and
          reproducibility. This sharing of anonymous data may include depositing
          data in open data repositories, such as https://openneuro.org, or in
          curated data repositories, such as the National Institute of Mental
          Health Data Archive (NDA). If you would like more information about
          NDA, this is available online at https://nda.nih.gov.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under some experimental conditions, the anonymized and de-identified
          raw data, such as generated word associations, may also be shared with
          other participants. In such cases, the raw data will be manually
          scrubbed of any personally identifiable information. If you have any
          concerns about sharing of anonymized data, please do not participate.
